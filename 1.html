A Test Plan refers to a detailed document that catalogs the test strategy, objectives, schedule, estimations, deadlines, and the resources required for completing that particular project. Think of it as a blueprint for running the tests needed to ensure the software is working properly – controlled by test managers.
A well-crafted test plan is a dynamic document that changes according to progressions in the project and stays current at all times. It is the point of reference, based on which testing activities are executed and coordinated among a QA team.
The test plan is also shared with Business Analysts, Project Managers, Dev teams, and anyone else associated with the project, This mainly offers transparency into QA activities so that all stakeholders know how the software will be tested.
Why are Test Plans important?
•	They help individuals outside the QA teams (developers, business managers, customer-facing teams) understand exactly how the website or app will be tested.
•	They offer a clear guide for QA engineers to conduct their testing activities.
•	They detail aspects such as test scope, test estimation, strategy, and so on. Collating all this information into a single document makes it easier to review by management personnel or to re-use for other projects.
Components of a Test Plan
•	Scope: Details the objectives of the particular project. Also, it details user scenarios to be used in tests. If necessary, the scope can specify what scenarios or issues the project will not cover.
•	Schedule: Details start dates and deadlines for testers to deliver results.
•	Resource Allocation: Details which tester will work on which test.
•	Environment: Details the nature, configuration, and availability of the test environment.
•	Tools: Details what tools are to be used for testing, bug reporting, and other relevant activities.
•	Defect Management: Details how bugs will be reported, to whom and what each bug report needs to be accompanied by. For example, should bugs be reported with screenshots, text logs, or videos of their occurrence in the code?
•	Risk Management: Details what risks may occur during software testing, and what risks the software itself may suffer if released without sufficient testing.
•	Exit Parameters: Details when testing activities must stop. This part describes the results that are expected from the QA operations, giving testers a benchmark to compare actual results to.
How to create a Test Plan?

Creating a Test Plan involves the following steps:

1. Product Analysis
Start with learning more about the product being tested, the client, and the end-users of similar products. Ideally, this phase should focus on answering the following questions:
•	Who will use the product?
•	What is the main purpose of this product?
•	How does the product work?
•	What are the software and hardware specifications?

2. Designing Test Strategy
The Test Strategy document is developed by the test manager and defines the following:
•	Project objectives and how to achieve them.
•	The amount of effort and cost required for testing.

3. Defining Objectives
This phase defines the goals and expected results of test execution. Since all testing intends to identify as many defects as possible, the objects must include:
•	A list of all software features – functionality, GUI, performance standards- that must be tested.
•	The ideal result or benchmark for every aspect of the software that needs testing. This is the benchmark to which all actual results will be compared.

4. Establish Test Criteria
Test Criteria refers to standards or rules governing all activities in a testing project. The two main test criteria are:
•	Suspension Criteria: Defines the benchmarks for suspending all tests. For example, if QA team members find that 50% of all test cases have failed, then all testing is suspended until the developers resolve all of the bugs that have been identified so far.
•	Exit Criteria: Defines the benchmarks that signify the successful completion of a test phase or project. The exit criteria are the expected results of tests and must be met before moving on to the next stage of development. For example, 80% of all test cases must be marked successful before a particular feature or portion of the software can be considered suitable for public use.

5. Planning Resource Allocation
This phase creates a detailed breakdown of all resources required for project completion. Resources include human effort, equipment, and all infrastructure required for accurate and comprehensive testing.
This part of the test plan decides the measure of resources (number of testers and equipment) the project requires. This also helps test managers formulate a correctly calculated schedule and estimation for the project.

6. Planning Setup of Test Environment
The test environment refers to software and hardware setup on which QAs run their tests. Ideally, test environments should be real devices so that testers can monitor software behavior in real user conditions. Whether it is manual testing or automation testing, nothing beats real devices, installed with real browsers and operating systems are non-negotiable as test environments. Do not compromise your test results with emulators or simulators.

7. Determining Test Schedule and Estimation
For test estimation, break down the project into smaller tasks and allocate time and effort required for each.
Then, create a schedule to complete these tasks in the designated time with the specific amount of effort.
Creating the schedule, however, does require input from multiple perspectives:
•	Employee availability, number of working days, project deadlines, daily resource availability.
•	Risks associated with the project which has been evaluated in an earlier stage.

8. Establish Test Deliverables
Test Deliverables refer to a list of documents, tools, and other equipment that must be created, provided, and maintained to support testing activities in a project.
A different set of deliverables is required before, during, and after testing.
